    <h1>The CVE Guessing Game!</h1>

    <h2>Riddle</h2>

    <p>What's the difference between these two CVE's:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;CMS Made Simple before 5.0.3 allows stored self-XSS via the HTML file import workflow.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;cPanel before 84.0.20 allows stored self-XSS via the HTML file editor (SEC-535).&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The top one is bogus. I <a href="game.html?xss-and-allows_CVE-2020-10114">derived</a> it from a real CVE, the second CVE (CVE-2020-10114),
combined with a corpus of XSS-related CVE's from 2020.</p>

    <h2>Mutated CVE&rsquo;s</h2>


    <p>I have mutated every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVE</a> from 2020, by mixing and stiching CVE's together.</p>


    <p>I clustered 15,730 distinct (e.g. not a &ldquo;RESERVED&rdquo; CVE) CVE's into 21 clusters, built a model for each cluster, then generated fake CVE's based upon the cluster it belongs to.</p>

    <p>Can you wade through possibilities to identify real CVE's from oceans of fakes? Pick a cluster, then a CVE.</p>

    <p> Within a given cluster, I ordered the CVE's according to complexity (number of mutations) for each CVE. Also, I downsampled highly complex CVE mutations, by presenting only a portion of the possibilities. Also, the <i>n</i>th CVE, for a given cluster, represents the (<i>n</i> * 10)th percentile. I.e., the 8th CVE (within a cluster) is more complex than 80% of the other CVE's in that cluster.</p>
