# The CVE Guessing Game!

I have mutated every CVE from 2020, by mixing and stiching CVE's together.

I clustered 15,730 distinct (e.g. not a “RESERVED” CVE) CVE's into 21 clusters, built a model for each cluster, then generated fake CVE's based upon the cluster it belongs to.

Can you wade through possibilities to identify real CVE's from oceans of fakes? Pick a cluster, then a CVE.
